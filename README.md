## CityDecides

### Description
CityDecides was built as a part of the author's undergraduate thesis project. It is an open source project built using the MERN Stack technologies (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) 
that still in the works. CityDecides is an online administrative tool through
which administrators in academic institutions manage and make decisions on which study pathways
and learning modules to allocate to final year students. By incorporating all the necessary features
for the allocation process into a single application, CityDecides aims to significantly reduce
administrative overheads and achieve a more streamlined, effective system when compared to the current manual followed methods by Universities and Colleges. Most importantly,
CityDecides assists administrators in the decision making process by depicting student preference
data in dynamic charts, as well as providing a user interface for students where they can submit
their preferences to be automatically synced with the administrator's dashboard.

### Installation

You can have your own instance of CityDecides by cloning the repo and running npm install, then attaching a MongoDB Atlas account.

#### Note: This project, although the current version of it is functional, is in a phase of refactoring, if you fork it, make sure that you sync your fork everytime.
